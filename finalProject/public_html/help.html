		<h2>RULES</h2>
		<p>Click which player you want to play as. Four pieces are placed in each of the 12 holes in the center.
			Each player has a 'store' to the side of the Mancala board. If you are player 1, it is on your left.
			If you are player 2, it is on your right. The color of the pieces are irrelevant.
			The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on their side.
			If you are player 1, your side is the top. If you are player 2, your side is the bottom. Moving
			counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each hole until the stones run out.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you run into your own store, deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's store, skip it.
			</li>
			<li>If the last piece you drop is in your own store, you get a free turn.</li>
			<li>If the last piece you drop is in an empty hole on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in
				the hole directly opposite.</li>
			<li>Always place all captured pieces in your store.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<h2>LAYOUT/BUTTONS</h2>
		<p>The "Player 1" and "Player 2" buttons are there for the user to choose whether they are playing as player 1
			or player 2.
			The HELP/RULES button takes the player to this page. The "Login" allows the player to login to their account
			for this game. The
			account allows the user to keep the game they started and be able to have a shot at being on the
			leaderboard.</p><br>
		<input onclick="goToIndex();" type="button" id="return2" value="Go to Game"><br><br>

		<h2>HOW YOU WIN</h2>
		<p>The game ends when all six spaces on one side of the Mancala board are empty.
			The player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the game ends captures all of those pieces.
			Count all the pieces in each store. The winner is the player with the most pieces.</p><br>

			future.</p><br>
